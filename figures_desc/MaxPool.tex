MaxPool is a size reduction function. It divides an image into smaller submatrices
(in this particular case into $2 \times 2$ matrices). Then it selects an element with the maximum 
value from each submatrix
and put them into the corresponding cells of the output image. When 2D MaxPool is applied to 
the colored image, it processes each channel separately. Usually, MaxPool is used right after 
the convolutional layer, which extracts the features from the image. In these terms, 
MaxPool gets rid of less important information. It allows us to reduce computations and 
the number of weights in neural networks.
